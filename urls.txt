# Edge Case Test: Interval 30s can be a multiple of both 10s and 15s
# Question: Which group should it belong to?
# Current behavior: First match wins (sorted ascending)
#
# Expected grouping with current algorithm:
#   Timer 1 (GCD=10s): handles 10s, 20s, 30s
#   Timer 2 (GCD=15s): handles 15s, 45s
#   Timer 3 (GCD=12s): handles 12s, 24s
#
# Note: 60s could be multiple of 10, 12, 15, 20... but 10 wins (smallest)

# Group 1: Base 10s (should capture 20s, 30s)
