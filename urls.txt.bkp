# Edge Case Test: Interval 30s can be a multiple of both 10s and 15s
# Question: Which group should it belong to?
# Current behavior: First match wins (sorted ascending)
#
# Expected grouping with current algorithm:
#   Timer 1 (GCD=10s): handles 10s, 20s, 30s
#   Timer 2 (GCD=15s): handles 15s, 45s
#   Timer 3 (GCD=12s): handles 12s, 24s
#
# Note: 60s could be multiple of 10, 12, 15, 20... but 10 wins (smallest)

# Group 1: Base 10s (should capture 20s, 30s)
192.168.1.1,10
192.168.1.2,10

192.168.2.1,20
192.168.2.2,20

192.168.3.1,30
192.168.3.2,30

# Group 2: Base 12s (should capture 24s but not 60s, since 30s already taken)
10.0.1.1,12
10.0.1.2,12

10.0.2.1,24
10.0.2.2,24

# Group 3: Base 15s (should capture 45s but not 30s or 60s)
172.16.1.1,15
172.16.1.2,15

172.16.2.1,45
172.16.2.2,45

# Edge case: 60s is a multiple of 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
# Should go to Timer 1 (GCD=10) since that's first
172.20.1.1,60
