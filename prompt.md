Generate a detailed progress report in an org file format from the perspective of a trainee software engineer.

The report should be based on the git commits for the current day.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Analyze the git commits for the day.
2.  Provide a commit-wise summary.
3.  Focus on significant changes, such as new features, bug fixes, and architectural modifications.
4.  Exclude trivial changes like file creation, formatting, renaming, or minor refactoring.
5.  For simple refactoring commits, group them under a "Minor Refactorings" section and provide a brief, high-level description of the changes.
6.  The final output should be a single org file.
